### Unimplemented Features
Due to time constraints, I was not able to implement every feature I wanted on this game. 
- Currently only Marcoh is balanced, the 2 other characters are not play tested enough to ensure that they are balanced, I am not sure if you can finish the game with them.
- The game has no background music or sound effects.
- Battles have no animations.
- All player abilities deal the same damage. I am planning to implement non-attack abilities (Heal, Buff, Dodge, etc.)
- All player and enemy attacks are guaranteed hit. I am planning to implement a hit-miss chance to balance attacks (High Damage = Lower Hit Chance, Low Damage = Higher Hit Chance).
- Battle UI can be improved.
